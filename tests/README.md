# Test dataset

This test dataset consists of several components that have been manually curated for testing purposes, aggressively trimmed down (with the exception of the DRAM Distill db).

The dataset includes a trimmed version of the human-vaginal-v1.0 dataset alongside a reduced human_phiX BWAMem2 index. For the sourmash sketch index, we created a custom for the genome [MGYG000303700](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/genomes/MGYG000303700/downloads/MGYG000303700.fna). Additionally, we generated simulated reads using [samtools wgsim](https://sarahpenir.github.io/bioinformatics/Simulating-Sequence-Reads-with-wgsim/).
